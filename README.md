## Block Disposable Email

### License
 - This ElkArte addon is released under a MPL V1.1 license, a copy of it with its provisions is included with the package.

### Introduction
This addon prevents people from registering with disposable email addresses (dea) like the ones provided by mailinator (also known as throw-away email, one-time email). It protects your most important asset, your registered user base, by preventing contamination by fake accounts.

### Features
The addon does not contain a list of domains to block, instead it uses the service of https://www.block-disposable-email.com. This is a very accurate free service for up to 200 queries a month. For larger sites several pay for plans are available.  Using the service is more accurate and prevents local maintenance of blacklists etc.

The addon, when activated, prevents both registering with a DEA as well as changing to a DEA (via profile edits)
